momentum
========

Team feedback and evaluation system.

### Abstract
Momentum is a web application that folks can log in to to provide positive feedback to others in the organization. This feedback can be optionally made public in a "feed" like window, where others can see the feedback being shared.

### Problem being solved
Have you ever had a bit of praise for someone in the organization? I have. In these moments, I like to walk up to the person and just tell them, "you're awesome." Or send a text message. Or an e-mail. But these bits of praise are "lost" once shared. Sure, they may be buried in someone's email, text cache or their brain. But wouldn't it be awesome if we could share these things in a more public forum, for others to see and draw encouragement from? I think so. Hence, this idea.

### Goals
* Build a Ruby on Rails web site that can
** accept user logins;
** accept feedback from one user for another user;
** render feedback others users have left for the logged in user; and provide a live feed of feedback being provided.
* Deploy to Heroku
* Should be test-first approach using Cucumber and Rspec Should be usable by end of day.
